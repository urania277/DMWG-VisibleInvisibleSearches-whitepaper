\section{Introduction} 
\label{Plots}

This is our explanation of why the LHC experiments produce summary plots for example scenarios, breathtaking in its clarity and brevity.

Do we address whether or not to map dijet and dilepton constraints to the direct detection cross section plots, as we do for the mono-X results?
